		<h1>Will You Marry Me?</h1>
		<p class="proposal">Shivu here, standing before you with a heart full of love and a soul that beats only for you.</p>
		<p>From the moment I met you, I knew that you were someone special, someone who would change my life forever. And now, as I look into your eyes, I know that I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy.</p>

		<p class="quote">"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds." - Nicholas Sparks</p>
		<p>You are the sunshine that brightens every day, the calm in every storm, and the safe haven where I can always find peace. You are the melody that fills my heart with joy, the rhythm that makes me whole, and the harmony that brings balance to my life.</p>
		<p class="quote">"Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope." - Maya Angelou</p>
		<p>Without you, I am incomplete, a puzzle with missing pieces. But with you, I am a masterpiece, a work of art that is beautiful, unique, and precious.</p>
		<p class="quote">"You don't develop courage by being happy in your relationships everyday. You develop it by surviving difficult times and challenging adversity." - Epicurus</p>
		<p>You are the love of my life, my everything, my forever. You make me laugh when I need it most, you listen when I need someone to talk to, and you support me in everything I do.</p>
		<p class="quote">"Where there is love, there is life." - Mahatma Gandhi</p>
		<p>I promise to love you with all my heart, to cherish and honor you, to support your dreams, and to be your safe haven in times of need. I promise to laugh with you, to cry with you, and to build a life with you that is filled with love, joy, and adventure.</p>
		<p class="quote">"Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend." - Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
		<p>So, my love, will you marry me? Will you be my partner, my friend, and my soulmate for the rest of our lives? Will you join me on this journey of love, laughter, and adventure?</p>
